# getinterviewed

1. **PySpark:**
   - *Topics covered:* Spark Architecture, PySpark hands-on experience, optimization techniques, and challenges.
   - *Scenario-based questions:*
     - "Optimizing a PySpark job processing a massive dataset."
     - "Data integretity issues -> JOBs Failing in between eg API request response saving and job failing"
     - "Handling errors in transformations due to data inconsistencies."
     - "You're tasked with integrating a new data source into your existing PySpark pipeline. How would you approach this, considering data quality, compatibility, and performance?"
     - "In a PySpark project, you discover that some transformations are causing skewed data distribution. How would you handle this issue to ensure a balanced and efficient processing?"

2. **Python:**
   - *Topics covered:* Differences between list, tuple, dictionary, and set; Python generators and decorators.
   - *Scenario-based questions:*
     - "Designing a data processing script using lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, generators, and decorators."
     - "Creating a Python script for analyzing a large dataset efficiently."
     - "You're developing a data pipeline in Python where you receive data in various formats (JSON, CSV, XML) from different sources. Design a solution using lists, tuples, and dictionaries to efficiently handle this diverse data, ensuring uniform processing. Additionally, implement a decorator to log the start and end times of each processing function"
     - "You're tasked with creating a Python script to analyze a large dataset. Utilize sets to identify unique elements, implement a generator to process data in chunks, and apply decorators to measure the execution time of critical functions. How would you approach this task, considering efficiency and maintainability?"

3. **SQL:**
   - *Topics covered:* SQL coding skills, involving joins, window functions, lead/lag.
   - *Scenario-based questions:*
     - "Designing a SQL query for identifying and eliminating duplicate records."
     - "Creating a report showing monthly revenue for each product using window functions."
     - "Imagine you have two tables: one with customer information (customer_id, name, country) and another with order details (order_id, customer_id, product, quantity). Your task is to generate a report showing the total quantity of each product sold in each country. How would you structure a SQL query involving joins to accomplish this"

4. **ETL Concepts:**
   - *Topics covered:* Slowly changing dimensions, data lake, delta lake, data warehouse, normalization, denormalization, data cleansing, metadata management, change data capture (CDC).
   - *Scenario-based questions:*
     - "Implementing a slowly changing dimension strategy for historical data."
     - "Designing an ETL process for rapidly changing datasets."

5. **Cloud Services:**
   - *Topics covered:* Cloud-agnostic concepts, adaptability, efficiency, and data transfer.
   - *Scenario-based questions:*
     - "Designing a scalable and cost-effective data storage solution in a cloud environment."
     - "Ensuring efficient ETL processes while maintaining data quality in a project with diverse data sources stored in a data lake."
